# Training models for Part 1

In this notebook we train several models separately from each other, to support later analyses of whether RNNs can be learn robust policies for a simple continuous control task. In particular, we train an RNN to drive a point mass from an initial position to a target position (i.e. simple reaching) in a 2D workspace. One model will be trained to do this undisturbed, while another will experience a disturbance which cannot be modeled (curl force fields of random direction and magnitude) on each trial/episode. In the latter case, two variants of the model will be trained, at two levels of average disturbance magnitude.

Multiple replicates of the model are trained in each case, to examine the effect of network weight initialization. 

Each model consists of a single-layer RNN with a linear readout layer, which controls a biomechanical model, forming a closed loop. On each time step of a trial, the RNN outputs a 2D force vector which accelerates a Newtonian point mass across a 2D workspace. The input to the RNN on each time step includes feedback observations of the point mass's position and velocity, as well as the target/reference position and velocity. In the case of simple reaching, the target state is constant across the trial -- the goal position and velocity of the reach.

Symmetric (Gaussian) noise is added to the network's outputs and to the feedback observations on each time step, to model motor and sensory noise in the system.

The training objective is to minimize a continuous cost function which penalizes a sum of the following squared terms:

- the Euclidean distance between the point mass's position and the target position on each time step;
- the **difference** between the point mass's velocity and the target velocity on each time step;
- the force vector output by the neural network;
- the activations of the network units.

In addition to the two main classes of models, we also train:

1. A model with increased system noise;
2. A model that is disturbed by a random force field -- state independent, and constant across a trial -- rather than a curl force field.
