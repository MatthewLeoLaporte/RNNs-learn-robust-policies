In each case, we should look at the following, across context inputs

1. project the fixed points into PC space
2. examine their Jacobian eigenspectra 

## Center-out reaching

### Find the structure of the steady (goal-goal) FPs

**TODO**: Do the structures (e.g. the goal-goal ring) change with the context input? (In principle the fixed points could remain in place, while the local dynamics change.)

### Find the structure of the initial unsteady (init-goal) FPs

Similarly, see how the structure of the initial fixed points changes

### Find the structure
