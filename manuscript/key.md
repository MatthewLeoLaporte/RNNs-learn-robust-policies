- **TPS**: Standard deviation of the distribution from which the training perturbation magnitude was drawn, i.e. train pert. std.
- **SU**: System uncertainty; in part 1 controlled by TPS, in part 2 by TPS * SISU
- **SISU**: Scalar information about system uncertainty
- **PA**: Perturbation amplitude during evaluation.
- **CF**: Curl fields.
- **SIRF**: State independent random fields.
