## Training networks with contextual inputs

- [ ] Some loss plots

## Plant perturbations

Show that changing the context input controls the robustness of the behaviour.

### Aligned trajectories

### Distributions of performance measures

## Feedback perturbations

Likewise, show that changing the context input appears to change the gains.
