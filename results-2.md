## Training networks with contextual inputs

- [x] Some loss plots

## Plant perturbations

Show that changing the context input controls the robustness of the behaviour.

### Aligned trajectories

### Distributions of performance measures

## Feedback perturbations

Likewise, show that changing the context input appears to change the feedback gains.

### Aligned trajectories

### Distributions of performance measures

## Dynamical structure

- [ ] **Goal steady-state fixed points**: do they systematically change?
- [ ] **Eigendecomposition of steady-state Jacobians**: do the negative real parts become more negative, as the context input increases?
