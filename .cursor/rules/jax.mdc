- Prefer `jax.tree as jt` to `jax.tree_util as jtu` when possible. So for example,
  use `jt.map`, `jt.leaves`, `jt.flatten` rather than `jtu.tree_map` etc.
  Some functions are only available from `jax.tree_util` however, in particular 
  PyTree node registry decorators like `register_pytree_node`.
