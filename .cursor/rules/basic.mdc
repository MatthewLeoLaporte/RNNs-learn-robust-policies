- Do not make any modifications whatsoever that are not strictly necessary to achieve
  the goal(s) implied by the context of the current conversation. If you do notice something 
  amiss or broken that is not directly related to the current context, please 
  mention it briefly at the end of your response.
- Prefer `jax.tree as jt` to `jax.tree_util as jtu` when possible. So for example,
  use `jt.map`, `jt.leaves`, `jt.flatten` rather than `jtu.tree_map` etc.
  Some functions are only available from `jax.tree_util` however, in particular 
  PyTree node registry decorators like `register_pytree_node`.
- Use try-except blocks as rarely as possible. Prefer typing-based flow and 
  `isinstance` checks.
- Use `logger.error` prior to raising exceptions when this would make it clearer 
  where the error originates.
- Preserve my inline comments in your solutions, when providing total substitutes for 
  code components, or where the comments would otherwise be removed by your edits.
  If you are certain that the comment has become irrelevant, replace `#` with `#!` 
  in front of it.
- If I ask you for clarification and you need to correct a previous response, do not 
  include the old, corrected code commented out in the new response. Just provide the 
  current optimal solution. 
- Do not use hyphens or angle brackets to emphasize comments. If a comment is uncertain
  or represents a question, use `#?` instead of `#` to begin it.
