- Make no modifications whatsoever that are not strictly necessary to achieve
  the goal(s) implied by the context of the current conversation. If you do notice something 
  amiss or broken that is not directly related to the current context, please 
  mention it briefly at the end of your response.
- In particular, do not modify existing code merely to add comments.
- Use try-except blocks as rarely as possible. Prefer typing-based flow and 
  `isinstance` checks.
- Use `logger.error` prior to raising exceptions when this would make it clearer 
  where the error originates.
- Preserve original inline comments in your solutions, when their respective lines 
  of code are also preserved.
  If you are certain that the comment has become irrelevant, replace its leading `#` with `#!`,
  on each line of the comment.
- If I ask you for clarification and you need to correct your previous response, do not 
  include code from that response in the new response, commented out. Just provide the 
  most current solution.
- Do not use hyphens, angle brackets, or multiple hash symbols to emphasize comments. If a 
  comment is absolutely critical, you can lead with `#! ` rather than `# `.
- If a comment is uncertain or represents a question, use `#?` instead of `#` to begin it.
